                    "If the global energy network is observed as a system, it consists of many interacting subsystems in smaller scales; therefore it is interesting to investigate to what degree the principles of large scale apply to smaller scales as well. The focus will be on structures/systems that are complex and complete technological products for which energy consumption in the form of fuel or energy source is a considerable fraction of their life cost, and when grouped they form major sectors in the global energy map. To be more specific, the focus will be on buildings (residential, office or industrial) and vehicles (automobiles, rail, ships and aircraft), since they are designed and constructed with a life span of at least two decades, and the process of consuming energy is part of their core function."
                    , "Robustness to short-term disruptions in various degrees is commonplace in the majority of structures. Just a few examples are backup generators in buildings, battery assisted uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), switchboard change-over switches between alternative electric power supplies from the grid, dual and backup supplies to critical systems (propulsion, power supply, HVAC, payload) which are commonplace in naval architecture, overhead design in marine power generation and propulsion (also to increase maintainability), and similar and even more elaborate solutions in aviation industry to also meet the aviation safety requirements. In addition, robustness to short-term disruptions will also benefit with the implementation of a number of technology initiatives (such as the smart grid, the total electric ship and others) which are underway."

                , "abstract": "The preservation and expansion of natural resources has been a major concern from early historic years. From the industrial age however, energy natural resources received top priority at the cost of increased vulnerability to interruptions of energy supply. Especially during the last half century, the world witnessed energy crises with global impact and increase of energy costs. Recent energy crises highlighted the need for closer cooperation between sovereign nations and international organizations in order to avoid them in the future, or at least to mitigate their consequences. The concept of energy security emerged out of this process, and until recently it has been the focus of researchers in the realms of strategic planning, political relations and policy making in the energy sector. Energy security addresses three problems: availability of energy sources, uninterrupted flow of energy and affordable prices. The first deals with the selection of an energy source or a mixture of energy sources for which the time required for their depletion is as distant as possible, and as such it involves long-term prediction or minimization of the probability of long-term shortage. The second deals with forming the provisions that secure an uninterrupted energy flow, and as such it involves minimization of the probability of short-term shortage. Finally, the third problem deals with measures to avoid high energy costs that may constraint further operations. The selection of energy sources is usually based on current pricing and legislating restrictions during the design phase of a project, while the energy cost is chosen as the minimum allowed by the imposed restrictions. Energy flow interruptions are mitigated according to the maximum shortage allowed by legislature or industry standards for each sub-system. The cost and availability of different sources of energy change during the project life cycle, while solutions that mitigate short-term interruptions fail to prove cost effective. The introduction of a risk management process could help avoid unpleasant consequences, or predict them. The aim of this paper is to illustrate that energy security is a risk management problem, and as such it can be applied from large to small scale of structure manufacturing and operations, taking into account the long-term lÎ¹fe cycle of an energy demanding structure. From this perspective, it can be applied both in the design phase as well as the operational use of all structures and processes for which energy consumption constitutes a significant percentage of their operational life cycle cost."

                    , "Longterm energy security mainly deals with timely investments to supply energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs, while short-term energy security focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance."

It is somewhat embarassing, to take pride of yourself of having good knowledge in a wide area of topics and strugling to put together some of those thought in text. And I do have knowledge in a wide spectrum of topics, but it turns out that I am unable to prove it, unless I obtain the capacity of transfering them in text.",

Starting from this post, I will make time to publish my thoughts, although I dread the reaction of the people who will spend their time reading them. Even if my written thoughts are going to be considered rubbish, I am going to write them down and shre them with the few brave that are about to read them."
